    "# In this document, our aim is to use the Decision Tree model and to create 25 scenarios. We will pick the top 5 Universities based on instances and also the top 5 majors in each of the Universities. We will then run the Decision Tree model on them, on all 25 scenarios to understand the Accuracy, Precision and Recall. However, a higher goal is to create these 25 models to predict the results for students if they were in any of these 25 scenarios.\n",
