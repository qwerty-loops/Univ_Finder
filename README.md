Applying to Grad School can be very expensive, both in the amount of time and money.
From requesting recommendation letters, school transcripts and reading about schools
that can take about 6 weeks. Adding on the need to take entrance exams like the
GMAT/GREs, that can bring the timeframe up to a few months. School application costs
range from $50 to $120, assuming someone applies to 1 dream school, 1 reach/target
school, and 1 safety, that’s easily $360. That’s not even counting the cost to take the
entrance exams. The bottom line is that it can cost a hefty amount.

Thus, for this reason, our team finds it very important to not apply to schools blindly. We
need to apply with a strong intent and purpose. As such, in this project, our team has
decided to build a Web App to predict a student’s admission probability to their choice of
University. In this way, we hope that our App will help students have an idea of which
schools they would most likely get into. This would help them focus their time on
schools that would better likely give them admission and not waste money on those that
are unlikely to give them admission.



With an increasing number of students applying to graduate school, both public and
private institutions, it has become ever increasingly more important to help such groups
utilize their resources as efficiently as possible.

Our project strives to apply machine learning techniques to model and forecast
admissions probability and also create a list of recommendations for students. While
looking for comprehensive datasets has been challenging, we were able to web scrape
and gather data that would be sufficient to train and apply our models.
We will
acknowledge that our model is not meant to be used as a final say or a tool that would
confirm the status of one’s application but to give a general idea of where one stands in
the pool of competition. In this way, prospective students would have a general idea of
where they stand and make a better decision on whether or not they should invest
resources to try and gain admission in the institutions of their choice.

Additionally, our model will also help recommend choices so as to help students
discover colleges that they might not initially have had in their mind and explore these
options. In this process, we also hope to encourage students that not getting into their
dream schools is not necessarily the end of their educational journey but there are
many other alternative choices that might be better than their initial goals.
